The 2nd had Moguro with the Master interacting with the viewer as if behind the scenes for a studio before delving into each episode. And the 3rd had Moguro and the Master playing outside in the snow as if reporting on an on-location event to the viewer before delving into each episode.", "genres": [{"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}]}
