{"id": 25473, "title": "Ishinomori Shoutarou no Rekishi Adventure", "synopsis": "A two-part video series in which Dr. Teng (a researcher at the Time Institute) and his faithful kappa assistant Pasuke travel through time, first to the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) and then to the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima (1561). In the second installment, they then look in on the last stand of the Japanese underdog hero Yoshitsune in Hiraizu mi (1189) and then, after spending so much time on the Genpei War, suddenly leap several centuries into the future, to cover the first time Nobunaga Oda used firearms in battle, at Nagashino (1575) . A mixture of live-action and anime, described by Japanese sources as a \"documentary with a touch of story,\" and presumably related in some way to Shotaro Ishinomori's multivolume manga history of Japan.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)", "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Samurai"}]}
