{"id": 36552, "title": "Pikachin-Kit", "synopsis": "A fifth-year elementary student named Eiji Toomatsu, and his \"inspiration\" buddy, a dog named Pochirou. One day Eiji finds a mysterious book called the \"Pikachin Research Book,\" and learns about the seven tools that make up the Pikachin Kit. Eiji presses a button inside the research book, and immediately a \"Future Amazon\" delivery arrives at his door with the kit. Eiji uses the blueprints included in the box to assemble the kit, but it seems as though 1% part of the kit is still missing. \n\nIn the franchise, the word \"Pikachin\" means the flash of inspiration or insight one gets about a new project, similar to the visual of a lightbulb turning on above one's head when someone has an idea. The concept of the franchise is \"invention is 99% plastic models, 1% inspiration.\" \n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
