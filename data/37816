The closest he gets to treading the boards nowadays is teaching drama part-time to unappreciative college students. His home life isn't much better. Wife Mig-yeong  is a socially ambitious nagger who's always working late, and son Hyeon-jun is in trouble with police after setting off fireworks on the roof of an apartment block.\n\nJust as Mig-yeong starts making noises about moving to a more upmarket neighborhood and sending daughter Hyeon-seo to an expensive school, Oh receives a lucrative acting offer. At virtually the same time Oh is told he's in pole position for a permanent teaching post. Only catch with the latter is it means giving up acting for good. No sooner has Oh sacrificed what he loves for greater financial security than a serious spanner is thrown in the works. He witnesses what appears to be Professor Cho sexually assaulting student Kim Ki-pum.\n\n(Source: Variety.com)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}]}
