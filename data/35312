Kashiwa was shown everywhere to advertise the new Kashiwa TOHO Cinemas opening the following month) while others were regional restricted (eg. Hissawwaza was shown only in TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku in honor of the theater's grand opening as well as being a collaboration with the Godzilla franchise and Tokyo Metro's new IC Touch campaign).\n\nNone of these episodes were released online at a later date nor included in any DVD release of Kamiusagi Rope.\n", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
