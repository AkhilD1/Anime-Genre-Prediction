My first kiss is on stage performing a play......! We've been friends since we were kids, and Izuru's always bossing me around. I have to write the script for our school festival play, which is a relief because at least I can steer clear of Izuru, who's playing the leading role of the prince...... But on performance day, the princess gets sick, and I have to take her place! I'm dreading the final kissing scene. We're just supposed to pretend, but now... our lips are... touching...! I know it's Izuru... but he looks like a handsome prince, and... he's actually kinda hot......\n\n(Source: Ebook Renta)", "genres": [{"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}]}
