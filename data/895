Attempting to locate the dragon balls, Gohan Son and Oolong arrive at the scene and are ambushed by several creatures known as \"Bio-Men.\" Training nearby, Piccolo attempts to save them but is then attacked by three mysterious warriors.

Who are Dr. Kochin and Dr. Uirou? What even is their purpose?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}]}
