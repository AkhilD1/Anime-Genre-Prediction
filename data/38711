Each episode is animated by a different person and aims to showcase what is normal for them and how they grew up to be regular members of society. They were made to promote NHK's awareness campaign for the documentary series. The animated shorts were later streamed on NHK's official website and again later on NHK's official YouTube channel.", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
