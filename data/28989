{"id": 28989, "title": "Maku", "synopsis": "\"There are two people who face each other in each space. Each pair keeps a few distance between their partners and find some fearful, tender, and comfortable feelings that fascinate them. The feelings are put into practice immediately, and they start groping each feelings. Somehow, I try to blend and connect them. \"Feelings\" are sound bliss for all who have a body and sense. I busily pick my feelings on the track of my life and reconstruct by animation to appreciate them.\"\n\n(Source: Yoriko Mizushiri)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Music"}]}
