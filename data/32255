Greatly appreciating that, Ayako gives Yuri a present - a beaded bracelet.\n\nLater, the school is preparing for the summer cultural festival, and Ayako's present inspires Yuri with an idea to make a decoration for one of the school's exterior walls - a giant picture made of ropes beaded with empty cans of different colours. All kids including Ayako then gather empty cans from all around the city and start creating the picture. However, the day before the festival is scheduled to open a typhoon hits the city, threatening to ruin the kids' hard work.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
