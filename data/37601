After that, Tokyo's sealed-off city sections gradually return to normal. However, since the high-frequency resonance, some \"bizarre events\" start to happen, and people find themselves being pulled deeper into more mysteries. Meanwhile, young people start to become aware of themselves and release their power hidden in their blood, discovering themselves as \"vessel of wisdom blood.\" Together, being led by something unknown, they meet, communicate, and face the unavoidable circle of fate, sacrificing their own lives.\n\n(Source: MAL News)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
