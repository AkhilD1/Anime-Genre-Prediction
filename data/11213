There, he soon encounters the native life-forms, although as a new arrival, he is unaware that he has ignored humans, and instead befriends a rabbit, a bear, and a fox. This little-known science fantasy is not to be confused with Chobin the Starchild, which started its TV run a month earlier. \n\n(Source: animevice) ", "genres": [{"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
