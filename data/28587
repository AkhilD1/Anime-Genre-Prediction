{"id": 28587, "title": "Modern", "synopsis": "I finished this film in only two months after the completion of Playground. Inspired by optical illusions, like Escher's paintings, I made the film using isometric drawings. my idea was to make a great film using only transformations of rectangular parallelepipeds. I applied the method of geometric animation, a technique used in Metropolis, in this film. Along with \"cell\" animation, I continue making films with the application of this method. Hopefully, I will eventually discover a third alternative method to use in my films.\n\n(Source: Mirai Mizue)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}]}
