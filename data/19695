{"id": 19695, "title": "Clover 4/3", "synopsis": "Studio Kaab's first work--an inspiring interactive animation.\n\nWe follow the lives and turmoils of seven outcasted 17 year olds and you--the protagonist. Between the aches of being a girl who's younger than her body looks or a boy who'd rather get into fist fights than give handshakes, we found a piece of ourselves within the outcasted teens that's abnormal. Like a four leaf clover. Which are said to bring luck even though it is a mutant in the sea of three leaves. And so the curtain rises to glimpse at these four leaf Clovers--4 boys and 3 girls.\n\n(Source: Studio Kaab) ", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}]}
