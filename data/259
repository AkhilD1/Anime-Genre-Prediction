{"id": 259, "title": "Happy\u2606Lesson", "synopsis": "One guy. Five girls. One roof. It's a recycled idea, but it never gets old. Happy Lesson is a kinetic take on an old genre.\n\nChitose shares his house with five ladies. One might think the continued attention of this many girls would be a good thing, but too much attention can prove to be painful. Did I mention they're also instructors at his school (hence the title)? Not only is he the subject of their abuse at home, but at school as well. Even when things finally calm down at night, all the rooms are taken so Chitose must sleep on the couch.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}]}
