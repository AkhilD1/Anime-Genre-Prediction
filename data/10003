{"id": 10003, "title": "Kago Shintarou Anime Sakuhin Shuu", "synopsis": "In these jokey short films, many of them crudely animated, Kago's sick sense of humor reaches its full heights of absurdity. There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes\u2014the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit\u2014although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?\n\n(Source: Only the Cinema blog)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 14, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}]}
