New trees were replanted densely but in the 70 years it takes time for them to mature, foreign markets have brought imported lumber to Japan. Now Tokyo's mountains are suffering due to unused mature lumber far too dense to support the original ecosystem of the mountains. Kino Tokyo Tree Products offers woods products, gifts, and crafts that embody traditional Japanese culture as well as responsible harvesting of the Tokyo mountain lumber.", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
