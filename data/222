Mikura is the brawns of the group, Harada is the brains, and Kurokawa is just a bitter ex-cop that likes to think he's in charge.

Their biggest case, however, could prove to be finding out why someone wants Kurokawa assassinated. \n\n(Source: ANN) ", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
